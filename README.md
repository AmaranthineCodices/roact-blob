# Blob: A central state store for Roact
A lot of the time you don't necessarily need to buy into Rodux just to get a central state store; you just want to store a "global state" across your entire Roact tree (or maybe your game, I don't know!). Blob helps with this by storing a "blob" of state that you update like normal state in Roact.

## TODO

- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Possibly batch state updates / Changed signal firing?
- [ ] camelCase and snake_case bindings for API for maximum appeal
