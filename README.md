# Blob: A central state store for Roact
A lot of the time you don't necessarily need to buy into Rodux just to get a central state store; you just want to store a "global state" across your entire Roact tree (or maybe your game, I don't know!). Blob helps with this by storing a "blob" of state that you update like normal state in Roact.
